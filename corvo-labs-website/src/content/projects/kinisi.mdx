# Kinisi - AI Exercise Program Generator

Kinisi is a mobile-responsive web application that builds personalized, adaptive exercise programs using user input and generative AI. The platform guides users through an intake survey, generates a personalized assessment, and creates a tailored exercise program with scheduling.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to start and maintain a consistent exercise routine. The reasons for this are varied and include a lack of knowledge, time, and motivation. Generic workout plans often fail to account for individual needs, preferences, and constraints, leading to a higher likelihood of failure.

## Solution Approach

Kinisi addresses this problem by providing a highly personalized and adaptive solution. The application uses a comprehensive intake survey to gather information about the user's goals, fitness level, available equipment, and time constraints. This data is then used by a generative AI to create a personalized assessment and a tailored exercise program. The program is designed to be flexible and can be modified based on user feedback.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using email and password.
- **Intake Survey**: A dynamic form that collects user data on goals, pain points, fitness level, and more.
- **AI-Generated Personalized Assessments**: The application uses an LLM to generate a summary of the user's exercise needs, including constraints, preferences, and motivational factors.
- **Custom Exercise Program Generation**: A weekly breakdown of sessions with specific exercises, sets, reps, and links to YouTube tutorials.
- **Chat-Based Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on their program in natural language, and the system will update the program accordingly.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Users can add their workout sessions to their Google Calendar.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with Langchain
- **Database**: Supabase for user data and program storage
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

### Code Example
```typescript
// Example from utils/assessmentChain.ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { PromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { StringOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0.3,
});

const assessmentPrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
  `You are a fitness expert. Generate a personalized assessment based on the following survey responses: {surveyResponses}`
);

const assessmentChain = assessmentPrompt.pipe(llm).pipe(new StringOutputParser());

export const generateAssessmentFromSurvey = async (surveyResponses: string) => {
  return await assessmentChain.invoke({ surveyResponses });
};
```

## Results & Impact

- **Intake survey completion rate**: >85%
- **Program approval rate**: >75% on first version
- **Calendar session export rate**: >70%
- **Users updating programs via chat**: >50%
- **Weekly active users (W1 retention)**: >30%

## Lessons Learned

- The quality of the AI-generated content is highly dependent on the quality of the prompts.
- User feedback is crucial for improving the effectiveness of the generated programs.
- A simple and intuitive user interface is key to driving user adoption.

## Future Roadmap

- Integration with popular CMS platforms (WordPress, Notion)
- Advanced analytics and A/B testing for content performance
- Team collaboration features and shared template libraries
