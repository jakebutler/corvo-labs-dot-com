# AI Writing Assistant

An intelligent content creation platform that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to help users create high-quality content with custom prompts and templates.

## Problem Statement

Content creators spend hours crafting blog posts, marketing copy, and documentation. The process is time-consuming and often results in inconsistent quality across different pieces. Traditional writing tools lack the intelligence to provide contextual suggestions or maintain brand voice consistency.

## Solution Approach

Built a Next.js application with a clean, intuitive interface that provides:
- Pre-built content templates for common use cases
- Custom prompt engineering capabilities
- Real-time AI-powered suggestions and improvements
- Content optimization recommendations based on best practices

## Key Features

- **Template Library**: 20+ pre-built templates for different content types (blog posts, social media, emails, documentation)
- **Custom Prompts**: Users can create and save their own prompt templates with variables and parameters
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of generated content with inline editing capabilities
- **Export Options**: Multiple format exports (Markdown, HTML, PDF, Google Docs)
- **Usage Analytics**: Track content performance and optimization suggestions
- **Brand Voice**: Maintain consistent tone and style across all generated content

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design system and dark mode support
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 API with custom prompt engineering and response handling
- **Database**: Supabase for user data, templates, and usage analytics
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with social login options (Google, GitHub)
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state management

### Key Code Implementation
```typescript
const generateContent = async (prompt: string, template: Template) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: template.systemPrompt },
      { role: 'user', content: prompt }
    ],
    max_tokens: 1500,
    temperature: 0.7,
    presence_penalty: 0.1,
    frequency_penalty: 0.1
  })
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content
}

// Custom hook for content generation
export const useContentGeneration = () => {
  const [isGenerating, setIsGenerating] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)
  
  const generateContent = async (prompt: string, templateId: string) => {
    setIsGenerating(true)
    setError(null)
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/generate', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, templateId })
      })
      
      if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Generation failed')
      
      const data = await response.json()
      return data.content
    } catch (err) {
      setError(err.message)
      throw err
    } finally {
      setIsGenerating(false)
    }
  }
  
  return { generateContent, isGenerating, error }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming Responses**: Implemented streaming for real-time content generation
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently used templates and prompts
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented user-based rate limiting to manage API costs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Results & Impact

- **500+ active users** within first month of launch
- **50% reduction** in content creation time reported by users
- **4.8/5 average rating** from user feedback surveys
- **Open sourced** with 100+ GitHub stars and active community contributions
- **$2,000 MRR** achieved within 3 months of launch
