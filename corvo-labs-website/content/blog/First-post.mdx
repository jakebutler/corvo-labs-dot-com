## A brave new world?

What if we could build a better future where humans and machines work together? Cue the spacey sci-fi music and some techno-utopian world. Honestly, that's what we're here to figure out at Corvo Labs. I'm Jake Butler - a product leader with 18+ years of product experience with a focus in mobile, healthcare, and behavior change design. I was the founding product lead at Life360, and have spent time across early stage startups up to large enterprises like Optum Health.

## What is Corvo Labs?

Corvo Labs fulfills a few roles:

* Crafting the future of healthcare: we provide consulting services with a focus in healthcare and wellbeing technology and behavior change design. I've been providing independent consulting off and on for more than 10 years and Corvo Labs allows me to bring all of my experience under one roof.
* A product experiment showroom to explore and facilitate discovery and learning. We intend to build that by sharing what we're working on, and what concepts we're exploring at Corvo Labs.
* An AI-forward salon where we focus on understanding problems, not forcing solutions. We also explore responsible use of AI across topics like training data, energy consumption, and privacy.

## The Corvo Labs Story

Crows and ravens are awesome. That pretty much sums it up. Check out Hollow Kingdom for an awesome new take on the zombie genre through the eyes of a crow narrator amongst a world where this narrator can communicate with flora and fauna.

Crows are incredibly intelligent, use tools, recognize people…so many awesome things. Just like our corvid companions, we believe in using cutting-edge tools, like AI, to solve complex problems.

### What's up with the brand?

One of the underlying philosophies driving Corvo Labs is humans and machines working together. I grew up on Asimov, Heinlein, Herbert, etc. so I've spent a large chunk of my life thinking about man and machine. I think we can work hand-in-hand; less of a Matrix-y dystopian universe and more of a Jetsons + Rosie. But it does require humans to remain in the loop.

With that, our branding is driven by humans, and highlights some imperfections. I drew the namemark myself intending for it not to be perfect. I converted it to an SVG file that uses math - machine-understandable language - so that it now has the versatility that digital provides.

With that, you've seen how we're getting started. Now let's see what amazing places we can go together.
