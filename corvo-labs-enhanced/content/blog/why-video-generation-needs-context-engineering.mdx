AI video generation has quickly shifted from an academic curiosity to a practical tool. New models can now take text, and turn it into short clips that feel surprisingly cinematic. But anyone who’s played with these tools — especially for the first time — knows something isn’t quite _there_ yet. Early experiments often produce overly abstract, inconsistent, or short outputs that satisfy curiosity but not creative intent.

What’s the missing ingredient? After weeks of trial, error, and reading documentation, the lesson I keep returning to isn’t _prompt engineering_ in the traditional sense — it’s **context engineering**: structuring _inputs, artifacts, and workflows_ so the model is more reliably guided toward coherence and control.

In this post, I’ll expand on _context engineering_, why it matters, and how it materially changes how we build with video generation APIs.

## Prompt Engineering Isn’t Enough

When I first started experimenting with video generation, I naturally gravitated toward prompt engineering — defining roles, describing scenes, and trying to manipulate outputs purely with text. I often assumed the more descriptive and carefully articulated the prompt, the better the result.

Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.

In my early tests, I used the default video generation endpoint with a 10 second cap, often yielding 5–6 second clips that looked “meh”: abstract, AI-looking, and lacking coherent subject behavior. Even well-crafted descriptions that I iterated on over and over couldn’t reliably anchor the model’s output.

This mirrors a broader trend in the field. A comprehensive survey of _text-to-video generators_ points out persistent challenges in semantic alignment and temporal consistency, even as visual quality improves [[1]](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-025-01314-3). For example, bridging text concepts into precise video outcomes remains limited by the _grounding ability_ of current models.

The takeaway? Words alone — even well-chosen ones — can’t fix ambiguity in video outcomes. Sticks and stones may break my bones, and words can't fix my video.

## What Does “Context” Actually Mean?

Before we go further, let’s define the distinction:

-   **Prompt engineering** is how you phrase your request
    → _Right words, structured descriptions_

-   **Context engineering** is what _information_ you give the model during generation
    → _Anchors, images, scene frames, histories, and workflows_

Prompt engineering tries to get a model to _guess_ your intent better.
Context engineering gives the model _less to guess_.

## Where Context Engineering Paid Off for Me

While reviewing examples from tools like the Hailuo web app, I observed a clear pattern: the best prompts had three things in common:

1.  **A clear subject** – an identifiable character or object
2.  **A defined scene + action** – the “who” and the “what” explicitly laid out
3.  **A reference image** – the user was also instructed to upload a reference image of their subject

I applied this insight directly:

1.  Instead of a vague description like “a robot in a city,” I specified _“a red-helmeted robot walking through Times Square at dusk.”_
2.  I passed in a _reference image_ showing the robot, giving the model a concrete visual anchor.
3.  I also passed in a _reference image_ showing the robot, giving the model a concrete visual anchor.

The difference was dramatic. Outputs became more coherent, subject identity more consistent, and motion more believable.

This pattern isn’t just anecdotal. Text-to-video research and tooling increasingly show that _conditioning on concrete multimodal context_ — especially images — tends to improve video outcomes. For instance, many modern systems improve results by conditioning video generation on intermediate images or structured artifacts [[2]](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/text-to-video-synthesis), yielding stronger visual fidelity and continuity.

## An Evolving Landscape of Models

To ground this discussion in what’s actually shipping today, consider **Google’s Veo model**: a recent text-to-video generator that supports longer durations and even synchronized audio. Released in 2025, Veo can produce minute-long clips from natural language descriptions and address physics and motion more robustly than earlier iterations. Even state-of-the-art models like Google’s Veo still require careful conditioning to achieve coherent results [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veo_(text-to-video_model)).

Despite this progress, even models like Veo and others highlighted in recent surveys struggle with the _core issue_ I ran into:

-   **Temporal consistency** — keeping subjects behaving logically over time
-   **Semantic alignment** — making the visual output genuinely reflect textual intent
-   **Scene coherence** — avoiding abstract or unintended results

A recent survey on text-to-video generators underscores these persistent challenges: even state-of-the-art systems have trouble mapping complex human actions or nuanced semantics into video sequences in a robust manner.

This means that no matter how advanced the model, its _conditioning signals_ — the context you give it — are what steer final outcomes.

## From Prompt to Workflow: What Context Engineering Really Means

Once I embraced context as the real lever, the approach shifted from “What prompt should I use?” to “What _workflow_ should I design?” Effective multimodal workflows increasingly rely on staged generation pipelines rather than monolithic prompts [[4]](https://www.upuply.com/blog/how-to-write-prompts-for-text-to-video-generation). Here’s the distilled sequence that worked best:

1.  **Clarify the idea** — Start with a clear textual brief describing:
    -   The subject
    -   The environment
    -   The action
    -   Style or mood constraints

2.  **Generate reference images**
    Use an image generator to produce consistent images of key characters/scenes. These become _visual anchors_.

3.  **Use reference frames in video generation**
    Maintaining temporal consistency often requires anchoring generation to reference images or canonical character representations [[3]](https://www.upuply.com/blog/ai-video-prompt). Many APIs support passing an initial frame (or frames) that the video model conditions on. This drastically reduces ambiguity.

4.  **Break down clips**
    For longer videos, generate in segments tied to consistent reference images and stitch them together.

5.  **Parallelize where possible**
    If you need multiple related clips, run parts in parallel rather than sequential refinement loops.

This workflow forces the model’s attention onto _structured artifacts_ — not just text — reducing uncertainty and anchoring outputs.

## Why Context Engineering Works

The reason this approach feels more effective isn’t just experiential. Text-to-video research shows that semantic control — the ability to map textual concepts to visual outcomes — remains one of the toughest challenges. Techniques that break down the problem into stages where you can effectively manage context (e.g., image → video, or anchored frames) consistently perform better than monolithic text prompts alone.

In other words:

> **Prompt engineering improves the interpretation of intent.**

> **Context engineering reduces the uncertainty around it.**

That’s a subtle but powerful shift.

## Broader Implications

As models improve, context engineering will become even more important. Rather than expecting models to infer everything from text, builders and creators will increasingly use structured pipelines that give models _what they need before asking them to generate more._

This mirrors trends in other areas of generative AI:
-   Retrieval-augmented generation in language models
-   Conditioning image generation on sketches or style guides
-   Prompting that includes examples as part of the input

In each case, the most successful approaches are _not_ about clever strings of words alone — they’re about _designed context._

## Conclusion: Think Beyond Prompts

If you’re struggling to get usable video outputs from text prompts, stop asking “How do I write this better?” and start asking:

> **“What additional structure does the model need to reduce semantic and temporal ambiguity?”**

Whether it’s images, reference frames, templates, or staged workflows — giving the model _context_ is the real lever.

So next time your model produces something abstract or inconsistent, ask yourself:

> **What ambiguity are you still asking the model to resolve?**
